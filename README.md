# The Isle-Hop Odyssey

#### A game made for JS13kGames 2024 with theme: Triskaidekaphobia

### Ahoy Corsair! Welcome to The Isle-Hop Odyssey, where you are stranded on an island with little more than your two legs and a soon-to-be-rusty ship nearby. Hop from island to island like a seafaring kangaroo - or maybe more like a seagull after a cake - conquering forts, battling crabs, and other scallywags as you sail through treacherous seas filled with giant squids and sea serpents just waiting to ruin your day.

### Your mission? Siege castles, recruit a ragtag crew (who might not know port from starboard), and loot dungeons, all while trying not to sink your ship or get pinched by a particularly grumpy crab. But don't get too cozy! There is a mysterious island no one talks about - except when they’re screaming in terror. The 13th island, The Cursed Isle, hides the nastiest dungeon of them all, home to a certain Balrog (or was it Balron?) who's been feeling a bit cranky lately and definitely doesn’t like visitors. So, buckle up, sailor! Your Odyssey awaits - if you don’t get eaten by a squid first!
